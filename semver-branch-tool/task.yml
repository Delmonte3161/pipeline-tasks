# Returns successful if branch already exists,
# OR if branch doesn't exist but was successfully
# created.
#
# Only returns failure if it can't talk to git repo,
# or if it tries to push a new empty branch & fails
#
# Intent:
# Designed for onboarding applications to
# a concourse pipeline for the first time.
# Since the semver resource will fail if the branch
# is missing, this was designed to create the branch
# automatically.
